# Retarded python based csgo cheat, GUI with websockets 
In this stage it's more of a concept, but it's kinda working so I'm gonna publish this anyway

You need to do on the first run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to use
1. Start CSGO
2. run `python main.py`
3. Open index.html from client folder
